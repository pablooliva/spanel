This module controls the loading of assets, data and the interaction with the user.

A user is able to filter the data that they see in the charts, as seen in the Scenario_Manager_Screenshot.jpg file, by adjusting the dropdown menus. Once a good configuration of these dropdown menus is found, a user can save the configuration for loading or reloading at another time.
